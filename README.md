# EARLY-FIRE-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
I created a low-cost fire detection system using a drone and deep learning (CNN with VGG16). The drone detects smoke, an early fire sign, by analyzing images. It reduces false alarms with an extra checking step. Tested in real and simulated areas, the system accurately detects fire early for faster response
